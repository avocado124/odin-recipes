        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin, made out of fillet steak coated with pâté (often pâté de foie gras) and duxelles, wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe or parma ham to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.

            A whole tenderloin may be wrapped and baked, and then sliced for serving, or the tenderloin may be sliced into individual portions prior to wrapping and baking. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderlon</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 ounces liver pate</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
        
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place beef tenderloin in a small baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over beef.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool completely. </li>
            <li>Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. </li>
            <li>Mix together paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture. </li>
            <li>Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center. </li>
            <li>Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to rest. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain and serve with beef. </li>
            
        </ol>
